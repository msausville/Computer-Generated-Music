## Architecture Review Reflection:
3/30/2017

### Feedback and decisions

#### Feedback we got:
- GUI methods (kivy vs pygame vs Tkinter) and comparison with gui and webapp
- Does the song ever modulate?
..* Maybe.  Pop songs are less likely to do so, and we can specifically pick songs that don’t.
- Where will we store data?
..* We considered storing the data in github, downloading it to our laptops, or possibly in a USB stick.
- Have we considered using organic generation, and using an evaluation metric to make a song more like something specific?  How would you evaluate this?
..* This could be really cool.  Making an initial “song” and then using genetic algorithms to find the song that’s “best” could be a great stretch goal.  We’d have to decide if we wanted to make a song that’s most “like” a One Direction (or other artist), or evaluate whether it’s the “best” music theory wise.



### Review process reflection

##### How did the review go?
A technical review was not the most useful thing for our team at that moment. We were at a weird point where we had gotten most of our basics fleshed out but had not started any of the hard coding besides finding libraries. We didn’t need help with our main ideas, but we didn’t yet need too much technical help. Given that, from a presentation standpoint, we were ready to talk about what we had and didn’t have many stumbles or major gaps in knowledge.

##### Did you get answers to your key questions?
Yes, we received advice for several aspects. We even got answers to questions we did not think of (at least with the UI question). Oliver also mentioned the possibility of song evaluation and autonomous tweaking, which could be a cool stretch goal to consider.

##### Did you provide too much/too little context for your audience?
We provided plenty of background information into music specifics. Some parts had more opportunity to be explained more than others. We are lucky to have several members of our group that are music experts who can explain what we need to make music.

##### Did you stick closely to your planned agenda, or did you discover new things during the discussion that made you change your plans?
We all talked about the things we had planned on talking about but as questions were raised we spent more time expanding on certain topics and brainstorming.

##### What could you do next time to have an even more effective technical review?
Could have practiced more as a team.
Could have come up with more questions.
