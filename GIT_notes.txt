GIT NOTES

# assuming allison is the name of your branch

How to push code that works:


-add stuff to your commit
-commit your stuff to your branch
-push to your branch with git push (while on branch)


-git checkout master (moves your computer to the master branch)
-git pull (gets most updated stuff from master)
-git checkout allison (moves you to your branch)
-git merge master (adds the new stuff from master to your code, so you can resolve any merge conflicts without messing up the master branch)
-Fix merge conflicts
-git checkout master (go back to master)
-git merge allison (move new stuff in your branch back to master.




To push to master do:

	git push origin master

To push to branch do:

	git push origin allison
